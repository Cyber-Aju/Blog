#The Art of Subtle Influence

*How to Lead When You Don’t Have Control*
*By Aja | Dec, 2023*

In the realm of leadership, the challenges of navigating personalities and influencing change often emerge. What if your colleague's behaviors hinder collaboration, or your team faces someone resistant to feedback? As a leader, it's crucial to master the art of influence, especially when direct control isn't at your disposal.


###Understanding the Landscape

Imagine being in a position where you can't mandate change but must foster it organically. This is a common scenario, even for CEOs. The question then becomes, how can you lead and guide your colleagues toward growth when they might not recognize the need for change?

In this blog, we delve into an unexpected source for inspiration: addiction research. Drawing parallels between subtle influence and proven strategies from addiction psychology, we uncover effective tools for gently steering colleagues toward self-improvement.


###The CRAFT Approach

Historically, dealing with issues like addiction involved two common strategies: confrontation and passivity. However, in the 1970s, a more successful approach emerged—Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), boasting a 70% success rate compared to the 30% of other methods.

###Key Insights from Addiction Psychology

To understand subtle influence, we explore a six-stage model for behavioral change. Recognizing that people often feel ambivalent about change, especially in the early stages, we introduce the stoplight analogy—knowing when someone is receptive to feedback ("green") or likely to resist it ("red").

###The Skills of Subtle Influence

Effective influence demands a set of skills grounded in preserving autonomy, utilizing natural consequences, rewarding positive behavior, and investing in relationships. These skills, drawn from self-determination theory and addiction psychology, align with long-term interests and intrinsic motivation.

-Preserve Autonomy
Reinforcing a person's autonomy is crucial. Feedback should not feel coercive; instead, it should respect individual freedom. Acknowledging autonomy explicitly can build trust and dismantle defensive barriers.

-Utilize Natural Consequences
Helping colleagues connect with the natural consequences of their behavior is key to inspiring change. By guiding them to recognize the costs of the status quo, you empower them to align actions with long-term values.

-Reward Positive Behavior
Acknowledging and reinforcing positive deviations from the norm is vital. Specific, genuine praise for constructive actions creates a positive reinforcement loop, encouraging sustained change.

-Invest in the Relationship
Building a strong, positive relationship is foundational. Strive to balance interactions with shared positive experiences, ensuring that discussions about change don’t dominate the relationship.

-Manage Your Own Reaction
Recognizing and managing your emotional reactions is crucial. Emotional responses can lead to counterproductive actions. By treating emotional reactions as opportunities for self-learning, you can respond more skillfully.


###People Problems Require People Solutions

Computer scientist Gerald Weinberg's insight that "No matter what the problem is, it's always a people problem" underscores the importance of mastering people skills. Subtle influence, when consistently applied, can create a workplace culture driven by intrinsic motivation rather than coercion and fear.

In your leadership journey, practice these skills in low-stakes scenarios to build habits for responding skillfully in emotionally charged situations. Remember, influence is an ongoing process, and mastering these strategies can elevate your leadership impact, fostering a culture of collaboration and growth.
