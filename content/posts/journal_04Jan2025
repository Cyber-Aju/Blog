### **04 Jan 2026**

Today my day was very fast-paced.  
This diary is my journal—to reflect each day’s perspectives, outcomes, emotions, and similar things, so that I can know myself better.

Today I was doing things worthfully, trying to stay busy.

- Applied oil to my skin  
- Folded clothes neatly  
- Ate fully, though the budget went a bit high because it was Sunday  
- Prayed two times today  
- Slept in the evening  
- Walked slightly  
- Exercised in the morning  

I initiated a project called **“Self Craft”** with purpose.  
I need to write its vision clearly next week.

I planned to wake up at **5:30–6:00 AM** from tomorrow.  
Hopefully, everything works out.

I also planned what I am going to do this month—abstractly.  
I don’t know how I will complete it or where I might lack.

I am fearing:  
*What if I break the discipline?*

Because last year I tried the same things,  
but uncertain things happened, right?  
So I lacked consistency and fell into bad habits.

Hopefully, I am starting again.  
Please Allah, make it happen—or give me the perseverance for this.

And lastly, I will try to write daily.
