# Learnings of the Day 04/12

## Learnings Today 

- **Binary Trees Operations**: Implemented various operations like insertion, search, and traversal (BFS, DFS).
- **Recursive Algorithms**: Explored recursive approaches for tree-related problems, enhancing understanding.
- **Error Handling**: Encountered and resolved type mismatch issues during implementations.

## Challenges Faced

- **Pointer Understanding**: Initially struggled with the distinction between '->' and '.' when dealing with pointers.

## Overcoming Challenges

- **Type Handling**: Learned to handle type mismatches through explicit type conversions.
- **Debugging Approach**: Enhanced debugging skills to identify and resolve conversion errors effectively.

## New Terms Encountered

- **Depth-First Traversal**: Explored pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals in binary trees.
- **Stack-based DFS**: Implemented depth-first traversal using a stack to manage the recursive calls.

## Future Interview Preparation

- **Advanced Tree Operations**: Plan to explore deletion, balancing, and more advanced tree operations.
- **Algorithmic Proficiency**: Focus on improving algorithmic problem-solving skills relevant to trees.
- **Error Handling Techniques**: Delve deeper into error handling and debugging strategies.
