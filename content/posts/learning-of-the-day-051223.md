# Learnings of the Day 05/12

## Learnings

### 1. Mirror of a Binary Tree
- **Description:** Explored the concept of mirroring a binary tree.
- **Code Example:** `isMirror` function checks if a tree is a mirror of itself.

### 2. Depth of a Binary Tree
- **Description:** Calculated the depth (height) of a binary tree.
- **Code Example:** Recursive approach to find the maximum depth of a tree.

### 3. Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree
- **Description:** Determined the minimum depth of a binary tree.
- **Code Example:** Recursive function to find the minimum depth.

### 4. Adding Elements to a Binary Search Tree
- **Description:** Implemented a function to add elements to a binary search tree.
- **Code Example:** `addElement` function adds a new value while maintaining the binary search tree property.

## Applications

1. **Mirror of a Binary Tree:**
   - *Application:* Checking symmetry in structures like file systems or organizational hierarchies.

2. **Depth of a Binary Tree:**
   - *Application:* Resource allocation, balancing, and efficient search strategies in databases.

3. **Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree:**
   - *Application:* Pathfinding algorithms, optimizing traversal in hierarchical structures.

4. **Adding Elements to a Binary Search Tree:**
   - *Application:* Building and maintaining sorted datasets, such as phonebooks or dictionaries.

## Errors Faced and Overcoming Challenges

### 1. Missing 'public' in Class Definition
- **Error:** Compiler error due to missing 'public' access specifier in the class definition.
- **Resolution:** Added 'public' specifier to ensure proper access to class members.

### 2. Semicolon in Class Ending
- **Error:** Compilation error caused by an extra semicolon at the end of the class definition.
- **Resolution:** Removed the extraneous semicolon to resolve the compilation issue.

### 3. Missing '*' in Node Declaration
- **Error:** Compilation error due to missing '*' when declaring pointers to nodes.
- **Resolution:** Corrected the syntax to declare pointers, ensuring proper memory allocation.

## New Terms

- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, and values in the left subtree are less than the root, while values in the right subtree are greater.

## Future Implementations

1. **Advanced Tree Operations:**
   - Explore and implement more advanced tree operations such as deletion, balancing, and efficient searching.

2. **Interview Preparation:**
   - Continue practicing tree-related problems to enhance problem-solving skills for technical interviews.

3. **Real-world Applications:**
   - Apply tree structures to solve real-world problems, such as optimizing hierarchical data storage and retrieval.
