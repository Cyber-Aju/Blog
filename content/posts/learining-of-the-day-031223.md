# A Journey into Hugo: Overcoming Challenges, Embracing New Learnings

## Learnings of the Day

Today has been an exciting day filled with valuable lessons and new discoveries. The primary focus was on setting up a blog using Hugo, a static site generator, and the challenges encountered along the way.

### 1. Hugo Basics

Learning the basics of Hugo, such as installing the tool, creating a new site, and understanding the structure of the configuration files, laid a strong foundation for the day's journey.

### 2. Themifying with PaperMod

The process of theming the blog using PaperMod was an enriching experience. It involved not only integrating the theme into the project but also configuring the YAML or TOML files to tailor the blog's appearance to personal preferences.

### 3. Git Repository Setup

Establishing a Git repository was a crucial step in version control and collaboration. This involved creating a repository on GitHub, committing changes, and pushing them to the remote repository.

### 4. GitHub Actions and gh-pages

Integrating GitHub Actions for deployment and setting up the gh-pages branch were pivotal moments. Understanding the workflow and permissions for the actions was an enlightening experience.

### 5. Content Creation and Daily Updates

Creating content with Hugo involves writing in Markdown, and today's journey included adding a test page. The question of how to regularly add and update content daily was addressed as part of the content strategy.

## Challenges Faced

No journey is without its challenges. Today, I encountered and triumphed over a few hurdles:

### 1. Deprecated Features Warning

The Hugo server threw deprecated features warnings related to `.Author`, which required a switch to taxonomies. This was a small bump, but it led to a better understanding of Hugo's evolving features.

### 2. Authentication Woes

While pushing changes to GitHub, an authentication error surfaced. This was resolved by switching to token-based authentication, aligning with GitHub's current practices.

### 3. Unmarshaling Errors

Configuring the `hugo.toml` or `hugo.yaml` files proved tricky, with unmarshaling errors causing build failures. This necessitated careful inspection of syntax and structure.

## Embracing New Terminologies

Every tech journey introduces new terminologies, and today was no exception:

- **Hugo:** A powerful static site generator.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automated workflows triggered by events on GitHub.
- **gh-pages:** A branch on GitHub used for deploying static content.

## Conclusion

Today's journey into Hugo was both challenging and rewarding. The hands-on experience not only enriched technical skills but also provided insights into best practices and current trends in web development. The path ahead is promising, and the blog is poised to become a space for sharing thoughts, code, and experiences.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting coding adventure!
