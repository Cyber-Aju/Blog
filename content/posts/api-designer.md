# Module 1: Introduction to APIs

## Learning Objectives:
- **Define APIs and their impact:** APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as bridges between different software applications, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.
- **Acknowledge the digital feedback loop:** Emphasizes the continuous cycle of gathering insights from digital interactions to refine and improve services.
- **Summarize the business benefits of APIs:** Business benefits include new revenue streams, expanded reach and retention, faster partnerships, mobile and omnichannel capabilities, interaction analytics, outsourced innovation, self-service integration, and organizational agility.
- **Identify API value through case studies:** Real-life examples from Amazon and Disney showcase how APIs contribute to achieving business goals.

## Key Points:
- Adopting an "API First" engineering philosophy, coupled with a microservice architecture, enhances delivery speed, system stability, and scalability.
- Notable companies like Netflix, HBC, and SoundCloud have successfully leveraged APIs for business growth.

# Module 2: The API360 Model

## Learning Objectives:
- **Define key focus areas for API success:** Identifies critical elements for API success, focusing on alignment, usefulness, engagement, usability, scalability, evolvability, manageability, and security.
- **Describe the API360 model:** A comprehensive model with four components - alignment and usefulness, engagement and usability, scalability and evolvability, and manageability and security.

## Key Points:
- The API360 model positions for API success by addressing crucial questions in each component.
- Recommended key deliverables include API roadmap, project cross-reference, organizational model, API business models, and business cases.

# Module 3: API Styles

## Learning Objectives:
- **Differentiate between API Styles and Standards:** Styles represent abstract plans for constructing systems, while standards are formal documents setting technical criteria.
- **Characteristics of major API styles:** Tunnel style (SOAP), URI style (CRUD), Hypermedia Style (REST), Event-driven/Reactive Style (websocket protocol), GraphQL, and gRPC.
- **Acknowledge advancements in each API style:** Understand the historical context, protocol stack, common implementation model, advantages, and limitations.

## Key Points:
- Each API style has distinct characteristics, implementation models, and evolving trends.
- Examples include SOAP focusing on XML-centric messaging, REST utilizing URIs and HTTP, Hypermedia emphasizing task-based interfaces, Event-Driven prioritizing asynchronous communication, and GraphQL offering flexibility.

# Module 4: Designing APIs for Developers

## Key Points:
- Good design principles involve functionality, usability, and experience, addressing both purpose and human experience.
- Developer Experience (DX) facets include troubleshooting, change management, education, visibility, and trust.
- Emphasizes the impact of DX on API goals, leading to increased adoption and shorter development cycles.
- The Vitruvian Principle stresses solid, useful, and beautiful design in API development.

# Module 5: Overcoming API Design Obstacles

## Key Points:
- Common API design challenges include cost, scalability, and security.
- Overcoming obstacles involves addressing perspective, bias, assumptions, and resource-related challenges.

---

# Module 6: Architecting Your API

## Key Points:
- API architecture involves creating a well-designed interface for exposing backend data and functionality.
- Well-designed APIs meet functional requirements (security, usability) and non-functional requirements (scalability, testability, reliability).
- Layered architectural styles include security, caching, representational, and orchestration layers.

---

# Module 7: API Change Management

## Key Points:
- Change management encompasses versioning APIs, providing a clear release history, supporting backward compatibility, and making strategic deprecations.
- Postel's Law guides the approach, emphasizing conservatism in actions and liberal acceptance.
- Strategies for extending interfaces involve preserving existing elements, avoiding changes to meanings, making new changes optional, and using semantic versioning.
- Tips include avoiding overextension, thoughtful creation of forks, and considering Hypermedia for change-friendly interactions.
