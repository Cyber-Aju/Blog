# Music & Me Project: Navigating Challenges and Learning Experiences

Today marked the inception of my Music&Me project, an endeavor to connect ChatGPT with Spotify APIs. The vision was to create a platform where users could chat with ChatGPT, have their emotions analyzed, and receive personalized Spotify tracks in their mother tongue and English.

## Challenges and Learnings

The journey, however, encountered a roadblock when attempting to set up the project locally. Running `npm install` in the command line resulted in an endless hang, leaving me puzzled. Despite my attempts to troubleshoot, the solution eluded me, leading me to seek an alternative.

In a shift of gears, I explored the MERN stack using CodeSandbox online. However, numerous errors added to the frustration, prompting me to pivot towards Flask in the Python ecosystem. Surprisingly, the transition proved to be smooth, but the challenge persisted in establishing a seamless connection with the Spotify APIs.

## Reflection

Reflecting on the day, it was a rollercoaster of exploration and troubleshooting, with valuable lessons emerging from the hurdles. While the initial goal remains elusive, the process has deepened my understanding of API integrations, project setup intricacies, and the importance of adaptability in the face of unexpected challenges.

## Conclusion

As the day concludes, I carry forward a day of rich learning experiences, ready to tackle tomorrow's challenges armed with newfound knowledge.

*Note: The project is a work in progress, and updates will be shared as the journey unfolds.*
