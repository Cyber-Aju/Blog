      <description>Under the pressure 1. Coding of the day : None 2. JS of the day : Expressions / Operations and Numbers / Strings Expressions and Operations : An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.
Nullish coalescing assignment (??=), also known as the logical nullish assignment operator, only evaluates the right operand and assigns to the left if the left operand is nullish (null or undefined).</description>

      <description>Thought Hard Day 1. Coding of the day : Merge Sort Can&amp;rsquo;t understand the code, but i tried to learn the logic. Merge sort is Divide and Conquer method algorithm. Advantage is in performs well even on large datasets. But it takes large space and it is slower than quick sort because of Not in-place. Not in-place is it requires additional memory to store the sorted data. 2. JS of the day : Loops and Functions Loops and Iterations : Labeled statements are an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program.</description>

      <description>A Starting Journey of 2025 Goals 1. Coding of the day : Selection Sort function selectionSort(array) { int n = array.size(); for(int i = 0; i&amp;lt;n-1;++i) { int minVal = i; for(int j=i+j;j&amp;lt;n;++j) { if(array[j]&amp;lt;array[minVal]) { minVal = j; } } swap(array[i],array[minVal]); } } Advantage of Selection sort is the Memory writes which is better than the Insertion sort and Bubble sort, It makes at most N-1 swaps. Memory Writes is a value overwritten in memory, and Swap operation changes the positions of the elements.</description>
